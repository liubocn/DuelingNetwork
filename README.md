# Deuling Network

This software is a python implementation of Deuling Network for playing ATARI games with Chainer package.

The original program is Deep Q-Networks written by Naoto Yoshida.

I modified his program to implement Deuling Network.

Requirement and 'how to run' is equivalent to his ones except that you have to change the number 4 in relu_mean.py when you would play other game.

Please check his readme file.
